      %h2 Our Story
      %p
        It started out as a dream, but 4 years on we have succeeded in creating a simple and luxurious hideaway in the (not too) wild outskirts of Talkeetna, Alaska.

        "I've been meaning to describe the wonderful three days my family spent at the Treetop Chalet.
        We rented the Chalet for the two bedrooms, two baths, and the kitchen facilities.
        All were great and felt like we were living in luxury. Very comfortable beds were a nice surprise.
        All breakfast foods were fresh with plenty of milk, OJ, eggs, etc.
        The view of McKinley will be spectacular if nature permits."

        "Great views of Mt. McKinley from the chalet living room! How unexpected! The place is unhosted but
        full of everything you could want. They thought of everything. Breakfast foods were perfect with many choices.
        I could cook if I wanted but didn't need to make a mess. The rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated.
        [...] I can't wait to go back!"

          %i What a Modern Luxury Chalet
        \- tiger62z on Trip Advisor

        "During our 10-day Alaska expedition, among five Bed&breakfast we stayed across from Anchorage ,
        Homer, Seward, Talkeetna and Healy, Talkeetna Treetop Chalet is the best. It is newly built, elegantly designed,
        spotlessly clean, and on top of them, it has one of best view of Mt. McKinley right in front of house and you
        can also see it through a big window from the living room. I just couldnâ€™t help staring at the mountain all the
        time. It was so gorgeous! I highly recommend this place. "

          %i The Garden Apartment is a great choice for two
        \- Tangible on Trip Advisor
      %p
        "We booked the garden apartment because it offered complete privacy for one couple, [...].
        It's perfect, with its own view of Denali, a full kitchen, large bath,
        and large living room/bedroom area. The owner was there to get us settled, told us how to reach her
        if we needed anythibg, and then disappeared, which is exactly what we like. Breakfast supplies were
        ample, the decor attractive, and the location just isolated enough from the tourist bustle of Talkeetna."
